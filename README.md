# fencing-replay

Open-source software for fencing replay systems

## Goal

The goal of this project is to develop new software for operating fencing instant replay systems. While the current software works, it has many limitations. For instance, it only supports a single video stream, does not support audio, does not support more modern hardware, requires manual action for non-light halts, and has very limited capabilities for recording bouts.

A full requirements list is [here](Requirements.md).

A rough software specification is [here](Specification.md).
